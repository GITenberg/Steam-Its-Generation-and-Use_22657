Steam: its Generation and Use

by William T. Hornaday


Transcriber's Notes

Some errors have been identified in the original text.
These have generally been corrected, minor errors without comment;
 for others the correction is marked with a faint underline and the
 original text may be seen by hovering the mouse cursor over the item.

Because of the size of this e-book, some of the illustrations
 have been set to open in a window away from the main window.
This is to avoid disrupting the display of the main text.
Links to these illustrations have been placed in the right margin,
 as have the original page markers.

As the original book had neither a Table of Contents nor
 a List of Illustrations, these have been supplied
 by the Transcriber in the header.html file,
 which may be used as the suggested start point.
