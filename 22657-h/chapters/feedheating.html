<h2>FEED WATER HEATING AND METHODS OF FEEDING</h2>


<p>Before water fed into a boiler can be converted into steam, it must be
first heated to a temperature corresponding to the pressure within the
boiler. Steam at 160 pounds gauge pressure has a temperature of
approximately 371 degrees Fahrenheit. If water is fed to the boiler at
60 degrees Fahrenheit, each pound must have 311 B. t. u. added to it to
increase its temperature 371 degrees, which increase must take place
before the water can be converted into steam. As it requires 1167.8
B. t. u. to raise one pound of water from 60 to 371 degrees and to
convert it into steam at 160 pounds gauge pressure, the 311 degrees
required simply to raise the temperature of the water from 60 to 371
degrees will be approximately 27 per cent of the total. If, therefore,
the temperature of the water can be increased from 60 to 371 degrees
before it is introduced into a boiler by the utilization of heat from
some source that would otherwise be wasted, there will be a saving in
the fuel required of 311 &divide; 1167.8 = 27 per cent, and there will be a net
saving, provided the cost of maintaining and operating the apparatus for
securing this saving is less than the value of the heat thus saved.</p>

<p>The saving in the fuel due to the heating of feed water by means of heat
that would otherwise be wasted may be computed from the formula:</p>

<p>Besides the saving in fuel effected by the use of feed water heaters,
other advantages are secured. The time required for the conversion of
water into steam is diminished and the steam capacity of the boiler
thereby increased. Further, the feeding of cold water into a boiler has
a tendency toward the setting up of temperature strains, which are
diminished in proportion as the temperature of the feed approaches that
of the steam. An important additional advantage of heating feed water is
that in certain types of heaters a large portion of the scale forming
ingredients are precipitated before entering the boiler, with a
consequent saving in cleaning and losses through decreased efficiency
and capacity.</p>

<p>In general, feed water heaters may be divided into closed heaters, open
heaters and economizers; the first two depend for their heat upon
exhaust, or in some cases live steam, while the last class utilizes the
heat of the waste flue gases to secure the same result. The question of
the type of apparatus to be installed is dependent upon the conditions
attached to each individual case.</p>

<p>In closed heaters the feed water and the exhaust steam do not come into
actual contact with each other. Either the steam or the water passes
through tubes surrounded by the other medium, as the heater is of the
steam-tube or water-tube type. A closed heater is best suited for water
free from scale-forming matter, as such matter soon clogs the passages.
Cleaning such heaters is costly and the efficiency drops off rapidly as
scale forms. A closed heater is not advisable where the engines work
intermittently, as is the case with mine hoisting engines. In this class
of work the frequent coolings between operating periods and the sudden
heatings when operation commences will tend to loosen the tubes or even
pull them apart. For this reason, an open heater, or economizer, will
give more satisfactory service with intermittently operating apparatus.</p>

<p>Open heaters are best suited for waters containing scale-forming matter.
Much of the temporary hardness may be precipitated in the heater and the
sediment easily removed. Such heaters are frequently used with a reagent
for precipitating permanent hardness in the combined heat and chemical
treatment of feed water. The so-called live steam purifiers are open
heaters, the water being raised to the boiling temperature and the
carbonates and a portion of the sulphates being precipitated. The
disadvantage of this class of apparatus is that some of the sulphates
remain in solution to be precipitated as scale when concentrated in the
boiler. Sufficient concentration to have such an effect, however, may
often be prevented by frequent blowing down.</p>

<p>Economizers find their largest field where the design of the boiler is
such that the maximum possible amount of heat is not extracted from the
gases of combustion. The more wasteful the boiler, the greater the
saving effected by the use of the economizer, and it is sometimes
possible to raise the temperature of the feed water to that of high
pressure steam by the installation of such an apparatus, the saving
amounting in some cases to as much as 20 per cent. The fuel used bears
directly on the question of the advisability of an economizer
installation, for when oil is the fuel a boiler efficiency of 80 per
cent or over is frequently realized, an efficiency which would leave a
small opportunity for a commercial gain through the addition of an
economizer.</p>

<p>From the standpoint of space requirements, economizers are at a
disadvantage in that they are bulky and require a considerable increase
over space occupied by a heater of the exhaust type. They also require
additional brickwork or a metal casing, which <span class="sidemark"><a name="page_112" id="page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span> increases the cost.
Sometimes, too, the frictional resistance of the gases through an
economizer make its adaptability questionable because of the draft
conditions. When figuring the net return on economizer investment, all
of these factors must be considered.</p>

<p>When the feed water is such that scale will quickly encrust the
economizer and throw it out of service for cleaning during an excessive
portion of the time, it will be necessary to purify water before
introducing it into an economizer to make it earn a profit on the
investment.</p>

<p>From the foregoing, it is clearly indicated that it is impossible to
make a definite statement as to the relative saving by heating feed
water in any of the three types. Each case must be worked out
independently and a decision can be reached only after an exhaustive
study of all the conditions affecting the case, including the time the
plant will be in service and probable growth of the plant. When, as a
result of such study, the possible methods for handling the problem have
been determined, the solution of the best apparatus can be made easily
by the balancing of the saving possible by each method against its first
cost, depreciation, maintenance and cost of operation.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Feeding of Water</span>&mdash;The choice of methods to be used in introducing feed
water into a boiler lies between an injector and a pump. In most plants,
an injector would not be economical, as the water fed by such means must
be cold, a fact which makes impossible the use of a heater before the
water enters the injector. Such a heater might be installed between the
injector and the boiler but as heat is added to the water in the
injector, the heater could not properly fulfill its function.</p>

<p>The injector, considered only in the light of a combined heater and
pump, is claimed to have a thermal efficiency of 100 per cent, since all
of the heat in the steam used is returned to the boiler with the water.
This claim leads to an erroneous idea. If a pump is used in feeding the
water to a boiler and the heat in the exhaust from the pump is imparted
to the feed water, the pump has as high a thermal efficiency as the
injector. The pump has the further advantage that it uses so much less
steam for the forcing of a given quantity <span class="sidemark"><a name="page_113" id="page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span> of water into the boiler that
it makes possible a greater saving through the use of the exhaust from
other auxiliaries for heating the feed, which exhaust, if an injector
were used, would be wasted, as has been pointed out.</p>

<p>In locomotive practice, injectors are used because there is no exhaust
steam available for heating the feed, this being utilized in producing a
forced draft, and because of space requirements. In power plant work,
however, pumps are universally used for regular operation, though
injectors are sometimes installed as an auxiliary method of feeding.</p>

<p><a href="#tabl_18">Table 18</a> shows the relative value of injectors, direct-acting steam
pumps and pumps driven from the engine, the data having been obtained
from actual experiment. It will be noted that when feeding cold water
direct to the boilers, the injector has a slightly greater economy but
when feeding through a heater, the pump is by far the more economical.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Auxiliaries</span>&mdash;It is the general impression that auxiliaries will take
less steam if the exhaust is turned into the condensers, in this way
reducing the back pressure. As a matter of fact, vacuum is rarely
registered on an indicator card taken from the cylinders of certain
types of auxiliaries unless the exhaust connection is short and without
bends, as long pipes and many angles offset the effect of the condenser.
On the other hand, if the exhaust steam from the auxiliaries can be used
for heating the feed water, all of the latent heat less only the loss
due to radiation is returned to the boiler and is saved instead of being
lost in the condensing water or wasted with the free exhaust. Taking
into consideration the plant as a whole, it would appear that the
auxiliary machinery, under such conditions, is more efficient than the
main engines. <span class="sidemark"><a name="page_114" id="page_114">[Pg 114]</a>&nbsp;<a name="illo_114" id="illo_114"></a><a href="../plates/plate114.html" target="steampic" class="ilanchor">[Pl 114]</a></span></p>
