<h2>LIQUID FUELS AND THEIR COMBUSTION</h2>


<p>Petroleum is practically the only liquid fuel sufficiently abundant and
cheap to be used for the generation of steam. It possesses many
advantages over coal and is extensively used in many localities.</p>

<p>There are three kinds of petroleum in use, namely those yielding on
distillation: 1st, paraffin; 2nd, asphalt; 3rd, olefine. To the first
group belong the oils of the Appalachian Range and the Middle West of
the United States. These are a dark brown in color with a greenish
tinge. Upon their distillation such a variety of valuable light oils are
obtained that their use as fuel is prohibitive because of price.</p>

<p>To the second group belong the oils found in Texas and California. These
vary in color from a reddish brown to a jet black and are used very
largely as fuel.</p>

<p>The third group comprises the oils from Russia, which, like the second,
are used largely for fuel purposes.</p>

<p>The light and easily ignited constituents of petroleum, such as naphtha,
gasolene and kerosene, are oftentimes driven off by a partial
distillation, these products being of greater value for other purposes
than for use as fuel. This partial distillation does not decrease the
value of petroleum as a fuel; in fact, the residuum known in trade as
&ldquo;fuel oil&rdquo; has a slightly higher calorific value than petroleum and
because of its higher flash point, it may be more safely handled.
Statements made with reference to petroleum apply as well to fuel oil.</p>

<p>In general crude oil consists of carbon and hydrogen, though it also
contains varying quantities of moisture, sulphur, nitrogen, arsenic,
phosphorus and silt. The moisture contained may vary from less than 1 to
over 30 per cent, depending upon the care taken to separate the water
from the oil in pumping from the well. As in any fuel, this moisture
affects the available heat of the oil, and in contracting for the
purchase of fuel of this nature it is well to limit the per cent of
moisture it may contain. A large portion of any contained moisture can
be separated by settling and for this reason sufficient storage capacity
should be supplied to provide time for such action.</p>

<p>A method of obtaining approximately the percentage of moisture in crude
oil which may be used successfully, particularly with lighter oils, is
as follows. A burette graduated into 200 divisions is filled to the 100
mark with gasolene, and the remaining 100 divisions with the oil, which
should be slightly warmed before mixing. The two are then shaken
together and any shrinkage below the 200 mark filled up with oil. The
mixture should then be allowed to stand in a warm place for 24 hours,
during which the water and silt will settle to the bottom. Their
percentage by volume can then be correctly read on the burette
divisions, and the percentage by weight calculated from the specific
gravities. This method is exceedingly approximate and where accurate
results are required it should not be used. For such work, the
distillation method should be used as follows:</p>

<p>Gradually heat 100 cubic centimeters of the oil in a distillation flask
to a temperature of 150 degrees centigrade; collect the distillate in a
graduated tube and measure the resulting water. Such a method insures
complete removal of water and reduces the error arising from the slight
solubility of the water in <span class="sidemark"><a name="page_213" id="page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span> gasolene. Two samples checked by the two
methods for the amount of moisture present gave,</p>

<p><a href="#tabl_46">Table 46</a>, compiled from various sources, gives the composition,
calorific value and other data relative to oil from different
localities.</p>

<p>The flash point of crude oil is the temperature at which it gives off
inflammable gases. While information on the actual flash points of the
various oils is meager, it is, nevertheless, a question of importance in
determining their availability as fuels. In general it may be stated
that the light oils have a low, and the heavy oils a much higher flash
point. A division is sometimes made at oils having a specific gravity of
0.85, with a statement that where the specific gravity is below this
point the flash point is below 60 degrees Fahrenheit, and where it is
above, the flash point is above 60 degrees Fahrenheit. There are,
however, many exceptions to this rule. As the flash point is lower the
danger of ignition or explosion becomes greater, and the utmost care
should be taken in handling the oils with a low flash point to avoid
this danger. On the other hand, because the flash point is high is no
justification for carelessness in handling those fuels. With proper
precautions taken, in general, the use of oil as fuel is practically as
safe as the use of coal.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gravity of Oils</span>&mdash;Oils are frequently classified according to their
gravity as indicated by the Beaume hydrometer scale. Such a
classification is by no means an accurate measure of their relative
calorific values.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Petroleum as Compared with Coal</span>&mdash;The advantages of the use of oil fuel
over coal may be summarized as follows:</p>

<p>1st. The cost of handling is much lower, the oil being fed by simple
mechanical means, resulting in,</p>

<p>2nd. A general labor saving throughout the plant in the elimination of
stokers, coal passers, ash handlers, etc.</p>

<p>3rd. For equal heat value, oil occupies very much less space than coal.
This storage space may be at a distance from the boiler without
detriment.</p>

<p>4th. Higher efficiencies and capacities are obtainable with oil than
with coal. The combustion is more perfect as the excess air is reduced
to a minimum; the furnace temperature may be kept practically constant
as the furnace doors need not be opened for cleaning or working fires;
smoke may be eliminated with the consequent increased cleanliness of the
heating surfaces.</p>

<p>5th. The intensity of the fire can be almost instantaneously regulated
to meet load fluctuations.</p>

<p>6th. Oil when stored does not lose in calorific value as does coal, nor
are there any difficulties arising from disintegration, such as may be
found when coal is stored.</p>

<p>7th. Cleanliness and freedom from dust and ashes in the boiler room with
a consequent saving in wear and tear on machinery; little or no damage
to surrounding property due to such dust.</p>
<p><span class="sidemark"><a name="page_215" id="page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span></p>
<p>The disadvantages of oil are:</p>

<p>1st. The necessity that the oil have a reasonably high flash point to
minimize the danger of explosions.</p>

<p>2nd. City or town ordinances may impose burdensome conditions relative
to location and isolation of storage tanks, which in the case of a plant
situated in a congested portion of the city, might make use of this fuel
prohibitive.</p>

<p>3rd. Unless the boilers and furnaces are especially adapted for the use
of this fuel, the boiler upkeep cost will be higher than if coal were
used. This objection can be entirely obviated, however, if the
installation is entrusted to those who have had experience in the work,
and the operation of a properly designed plant is placed in the hands of
intelligent labor.</p>

<p>Many tables have been published with a view to comparing the two fuels.
Such of these as are based solely on the relative calorific values of
oil and coal are of limited <span class="sidemark"><a name="page_216" id="page_216">[Pg 216]</a>&nbsp;<a name="illo_216" id="illo_216"></a><a href="../plates/plate216.html" target="steampic" class="ilanchor">[Pl 216]</a></span> <span class="sidemark"><br /><a name="page_217" id="page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span> value, inasmuch as the efficiencies to be
obtained with oil are higher than that obtainable with coal. <a href="#tabl_47">Table 47</a>
takes into consideration the variation in efficiency with the two fuels,
but is based on a constant calorific value for oil and coal. <a href="#tabl_47">This table</a>,
like others of a similar nature, while useful as a rough guide, cannot
be considered as an accurate basis for comparison. This is due to the
fact that there are numerous factors entering into the problem which
affect the saving possible to a much greater extent than do the relative
calorific values of two fuels. Some of the features to be considered in
arriving at the true basis for comparison are the labor saving possible,
the space available for fuel storage, the facilities for conveying the
oil by pipe lines, the hours during which a plant is in operation, the
load factor, the quantity of coal required for banking fires, etc., etc.
The only exact method of estimating the relative advantages and costs of
the two fuels is by considering the operating expenses of the plant with
each in turn, including the costs of every item entering into the
problem.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Burning Oil Fuel</span>&mdash;The requirements for burning petroleum are as follows:</p>

<p>1st. Its atomization must be thorough.</p>

<p>2nd. When atomized it must be brought into contact with the requisite
quantity of air for its combustion, and this quantity must be at the
same time a minimum to obviate loss in stack gases.</p>

<p>3rd. The mixture must be burned in a furnace where a refractory material
radiates heat to assist in the combustion, and the furnace must stand up
under the high temperatures developed.</p>

<p>4th. The combustion must be completed before the gases come into contact
with the heating surfaces or otherwise the flame will be extinguished,
possibly to ignite later in the flue connection or in the stack.</p>

<p>5th. There must be no localization of the heat on certain portions of
the heating surfaces or trouble will result from overheating and
blistering.</p>

<p>The first requirement is met by the selection of a proper burner.</p>

<p>The second requirement is fulfilled by properly introducing the air into
the furnace, either through checkerwork under the burners or through
openings around them, and by controlling the quantity of air to meet
variations in furnace conditions.</p>

<p>The third requirement is provided for by installing a furnace so
designed as to give a sufficient area of heated brickwork to radiate the
heat required to maintain a proper furnace temperature.</p>

<p>The fourth requirement is provided for by giving ample space for the
combustion of the mixture of atomized oil and air, and a gas travel of
sufficient length to insure that this combustion be completed before the
gases strike the heating surfaces.</p>

<p>The fifth requirement is fulfilled by the adoption of a suitable burner
in connection with the furnace meeting the other requirements. A burner
must be used from which the flame will not impinge directly on the
heating surface and must be located where such action cannot take place.
If suitable burners properly located are not used, not only is the heat
localized with disastrous results, but the efficiency is lowered by the
cooling of the gases before combustion is completed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oil Burners</span>&mdash;The functions of an oil burner is to atomize or vaporize
the fuel so that it may be burned like a gas. All burners may be
classified under three general types: 1st, spray burners, in which the
oil is atomized by steam or compressed air; 2nd, vapor burners, in which
the oil is converted into vapor and then passed into the <span class="sidemark"><a name="page_218" id="page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span> furnace; 3rd,
mechanical burners, in which the oil is atomized by submitting it to a
high pressure and passing it through a small orifice.</p>

<p>Vapor burners have never been in general use and will not be discussed.</p>

<p>Spray burners are almost universally used for land practice and the
simplicity of the steam atomizer and the excellent economy of the better
types, together with the low oil pressure and temperature required makes
this type a favorite for stationary plants, where the loss of fresh
water is not a vital consideration. In marine work, or in any case where
it is advisable to save feed water that otherwise would have to be added
in the form of &ldquo;make-up&rdquo;, either compressed air or mechanical means are
used for atomization. Spray burners using compressed air as the
atomizing agent are in satisfactory operation in some plants, but their
use is not general. Where there is no necessity of saving raw feed
water, the greater simplicity and economy of the steam spray atomizer is
generally the most satisfactory. The air burners require blowers,
compressors or other apparatus which occupy space that might be
otherwise utilized and require attention that is not necessary where
steam is used.</p>

<p>Steam spray burners of the older types had disadvantages in that they
were so designed that there was a tendency for the nozzle to clog with
sludge or coke formed from the oil by the heat, without means of being
readily cleaned. This has been overcome in the more modern types.</p>

<p>Steam spray burners, as now used, may be divided into two classes: 1st,
inside mixers; and 2nd, outside mixers. In the former the steam and oil
come into contact within the burner and the mixture is atomized in
passing through the orifice of the burner nozzle.</p>

<div class="linecentr"><img src="../images/png2181.png" alt="Oil Burner" title="Oil Burner" />
<h4><span class="smcap">Fig. 28. Peabody Oil Burner</span></h4></div>

<p>In the outside mixing class the steam flows through a narrow slot or
horizontal row of small holes in the burner nozzle; the oil flows
through a similar slot or hole above the steam orifice, and is picked up
by the steam outside of the burner and is atomized. Fig. 28 shows a type
of the Peabody burner of this class, which has <span class="sidemark"><a name="page_219" id="page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span> given eminent
satisfaction. The construction is evident from the cut. It will be noted
that the portions of the burner forming the orifice may be readily
replaced in case of wear, or if it is desired to alter the form of the
flame.</p>

<p>Where burners of the spray type are used, heating the oil is of
advantage not only in causing it to be atomized more easily, but in
aiding economical combustion. The temperature is, of course, limited by
the flash point of the oil used, but within the limit of this
temperature there is no danger of decomposition or of carbon deposits on
the supply pipes. Such heating should be done close to the boiler to
minimize radiation loss. If the temperature is raised to a point where
an appreciable vaporization occurs, the oil will flow irregularly from
the burner and cause the flame to sputter.</p>

<p>On both steam and air atomizing types, a by-pass should be installed
between the steam or air and the oil pipes to provide for the blowing
out of the oil duct. Strainers should be provided for removing sludge
from the fuel and should be so located as to allow for rapid removal,
cleaning and replacing.</p>

<p>Mechanical burners have been in use for some time in European countries,
but their introduction and use has been of only recent occurrence in the
United States. Here as already stated, the means for atomization are
purely mechanical. The most successful of the mechanical atomizers up to
the present have been of the round flame type, and only these will be
considered. Experiments have been made with flat flame mechanical
burners, but their satisfactory action has been confined to instances
where it is only necessary to burn a small quantity of oil through each
individual burner.</p>

<p>This system of oil burning is especially adapted for marine work as the
quantity of steam for putting pressure on the oil is small and the
condensed steam may be returned to the system.</p>

<p>The only method by which successful mechanical atomization has been
accomplished is one by which the oil is given a whirling motion within
the burner tip. This is done either by forcing the oil through a passage
of helical form or by delivering it tangentially to a circular chamber
from which there is a central outlet. The oil is fed to these burners
under a pressure which varies with the make of the burner and the rates
at which individual burners are using oil. The oil particles fly off
from such a burner in straight lines in the form of a cone rather than
in the form of a spiral spray, as might be supposed.</p>

<p>With burners of the mechanical atomizing design, the method of
introducing air for combustion and the velocity of this air are of the
greatest importance in securing good combustion and in the effects on
the character and shape of the flame. Such burners are located at the
front of the furnace and various methods have been tried for introducing
the air for combustion. Where, in the spray burners, air is ordinarily
admitted through a checkerwork under the burner proper, with the
mechanical burner, it is almost universally admitted around the burner.
Early experiments with these air distributors were confined largely to
single or duplicate cones used with the idea of directing the air to the
axis of the burner. A highly successful method of such air introduction,
developed by Messrs. Peabody and Irish of The Babcock &amp; Wilcox Co., is
by means of what they term an &ldquo;impeller plate&rdquo;. This consists of a
circular metal disk with an opening at the center for the oil burner and
with radial metal strips from the center to the periphery turned at an
angle which in the later designs may be altered to give the air supply
demanded by the rate of combustion.</p>
<p><span class="sidemark"><a name="page_220" id="page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span></p>
<p>The air so admitted does not necessarily require a whirling motion, but
experiments show that where the air is brought into contact with the oil
spray with the right &ldquo;twist&rdquo;, better combustion is secured and lower air
pressures and less refinement of adjustment of individual burners are
required.</p>

<p>Mechanical burners have a distinct advantage over those in which steam
is used as the atomizing agent in that they lend themselves more readily
to adjustment under wider variations of load. For a given horse power
there will ordinarily be installed a much greater number of mechanical
than steam atomizing burners. This in itself is a means to better
regulation, for with the steam atomizing burner, if one of a number is
shut off, there is a marked decrease in efficiency. This is due to the
fact that with the air admitted under the burner, it is ordinarily
passing through the checkerwork regardless of whether it is being
utilized for combustion or not. With a mechanical burner, on the other
hand, where individual burners are shut off, air that would be admitted
for such burner, were it in operation, may also be shut off and there
will be no undue loss from excess air.</p>

<p>Further adjustment to meet load conditions is possible by a change in
the oil pressure acting on all burners at once. A good burner will
atomize moderately heavy oil with an oil pressure as low as 30 pounds
per square inch and from that point up to 200 pounds or above. The
heating of the oil also has an effect on the capacity of individual
burners and in this way a third method of adjustment is given. Under
working conditions, the oil pressure remaining constant, the capacity of
each burner will decrease as the temperature of the oil is increased
though at low temperatures the reverse is the case. Some experiments
with a Texas crude oil having a flash point of 210 degrees showed that
the capacity of a mechanical atomizing burner of the Peabody type
increased from 80 degrees Fahrenheit to 110 degrees Fahrenheit, from
which point it fell off rapidly to 140 degrees and then more slowly to
the flash point.</p>

<p>The above methods, together with the regulation possible through
manipulation of the boiler dampers, indicate the wide range of load
conditions that may be handled with an installation of this class of
burners.</p>

<p>As has already been stated, results with mechanical atomizing burners
that may be considered very successful have been limited almost entirely
to cases where forced blast of some description has been used, the high
velocity of the air entering being of material assistance in securing
the proper mixture of air with the oil spray. Much has been done and is
being done in the way of experiment with this class of apparatus toward
developing a successful mechanical atomizing burner for use with natural
draft, and there appears to be no reason why such experiments should not
eventually produce satisfactory results.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Steam Consumption of Burners</span>&mdash;The Bureau of Steam Engineering, U. S.
Navy, made in 1901 an exhaustive series of tests of various oil burners
that may be considered as representing, in so far as the performance of
the burners themselves is concerned, the practice of that time. These
tests showed that a burner utilizing air as an atomizing agent, required
for compressing the air from 1.06 to 7.45 per cent of the total steam
generated, the average being 3.18 per cent. Four tests of steam
atomizing burners showed a consumption of 3.98 to 5.77 per cent of the
total steam, the average being 4.8 per cent.</p>

<p>Improvement in burner design has largely reduced the steam consumption,
though to a greater degree in steam than in air atomizing burners.
Recent experiments <span class="sidemark"><a name="page_221" id="page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span> show that a good steam atomizing burner will require
approximately 2 per cent of the total steam generated by the boiler
operated at or about its rated capacity. This figure will decrease as
the capacity is increased and is so low as to be practically negligible,
except in cases where the question of loss of feed water is all
important. There are no figures available as to the actual steam
consumption of mechanical atomizing burners but apparently this is small
if the requirement is understood to be entirely apart from the steam
consumption of the apparatus producing the forced blast.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Capacity of Burners</span>&mdash;A good steam atomizing burner properly located in a
well-designed oil furnace has a capacity of somewhat over 400 horse
power. This question of capacity of individual burners is largely one of
the proper relation between the number of burners used and the furnace
volume. In some recent tests with a Babcock &amp; Wilcox boiler of 640 rated
horse power, equipped with three burners, approximately 1350 horse power
was developed with an available draft of .55 inch at the damper or 450
horse power per burner. Four burners were also tried in the same furnace
but the total steam generated did not exceed 1350 horse power or in this
instance 338 horse power per burner.</p>

<p>From the nature of mechanical atomizing burners, individual burners have
not as large a capacity as the steam atomizing class. In some tests on a
Babcock &amp; Wilcox marine boiler, equipped with mechanical atomizing
burners, the maximum horse power developed per burner was approximately
105. Here again the burner capacity is largely one of proper relation
between furnace volume and number of burners.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Furnace Design</span>&mdash;Too much stress cannot be laid on the importance of
furnace design for the use of this class of fuel. Provided a good type
of burner is adopted the furnace arrangement and the method of
introducing air for combustion into the furnace are the all important
factors. No matter what the type of burner, satisfactory results cannot
be secured in a furnace not suited to the fuel.</p>

<p>The Babcock &amp; Wilcox Co. has had much experience with the burning of oil
as fuel and an extended series of experiments by Mr. E. H. Peabody led
to the development and adoption of the Peabody furnace as being most
eminently suited for this class of work. Fig. 29 shows such a furnace
applied to a Babcock &amp; Wilcox boiler, and with slight modification it
can be as readily applied to any boiler of The Babcock &amp; Wilcox Co.
manufacture. In the description of this furnace, its points of advantage
cover the requirements of oil-burning furnaces in general.</p>

<p>The atomized oil is introduced into the furnace in the direction in
which it increases in height. This increase in furnace volume in the
direction of the flame insures free expansion and a thorough mixture of
the oil with the air, and the consequent complete combustion of the
gases before they come into contact with the tube heating surfaces. In
such a furnace flat flame burners should be used, preferably of the
Peabody type, in which the flame spreads outward toward the sides in the
form of a fan. There is no tendency of the flames to impinge directly on
the heating surfaces, and the furnace can handle any quantity of flame
without danger of tube difficulties. The burners should be so located
that the flames from individual burners do not interfere nor impinge to
any extent on the side walls of the furnace, an even distribution of
heat being secured in this manner. The burners are operated from the
boiler front and peepholes are supplied through which the operator may
watch the flame while regulating the burners. The burners can be
removed, inspected, or cleaned and replaced in a few minutes. Air is
admitted through a checkerwork of fire brick supported on the furnace
floor, the openings in the checkerwork being so arranged as to give the
best economic results in combustion. <span class="sidemark"><br /><a name="page_222" id="page_222">[Pg 222]</a>&nbsp;<a name="illo_222" id="illo_222"></a><a href="../plates/plate222.html" target="steampic" class="ilanchor">[Pl 222]</a></span></p>

With steam atomizing burners introduced through the front of the boiler
in stationary practice, it is usually in the direction in which the
furnace decreases in height and it is with such an arrangement that
difficulties through the loss of tubes may be expected. With such an
arrangement, the flame may impinge directly upon the tube surfaces and
tube troubles from this source may arise, particularly where the feed
water has a tendency toward rapid scale formation. Such difficulties may
be the result of a blowpipe action on the part of the burner, the over
heating of the tube due to oil or scale within, or the actual erosion of
the metal by particles of oil improperly atomized. Such action need not
be anticipated, provided the oil is burned with a short flame. The
flames from mechanical atomizing burners have a less velocity of
projection than those from steam atomizing burners and if introduced
into the higher end of the furnace, should not lead to tube difficulties
provided they are properly located and operated. This class of burner
also will give the most satisfactory results if introduced so that the
flames travel in the direction of increase in furnace volume. This is
perhaps best exemplified by the very good results secured with
mechanical atomizing burners and Babcock &amp; Wilcox marine boilers in
which, due to the fact that the boilers are fired from the low end, the
flames from burners introduced through the front are in this direction.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Operation of Burners</span>&mdash;When burners are not in use, or when they are
being started up, care must be taken to prevent oil from flowing and
collecting on the floor of the furnace before it is ignited. In starting
a burner, the atomized fuel may be ignited by a burning wad of oil-soaked
waste held before it on an iron rod. To insure quick ignition, the steam
supply should be cut down. But little practice is required to become an
adept at lighting an oil fire. When ignition has taken place and the
furnace brought to an even heat, the steam should be cut down to the
minimum amount required for atomization. This amount can be determined
from the appearance of the flame. If sufficient steam is not supplied,
particles of burning oil will drop to the furnace floor, giving a
scintillating appearance to the flame. The steam valves should be opened
just sufficiently to overcome this scintillating action.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Air Supply</span>&mdash;From the nature of the fuel and the method of burning, the
quantity of air for combustion may be minimized. As with other fuels,
when the amount of air admitted is the minimum which will completely
consume the oil, the results are the best. The excess or deficiency of
air can be judged by the appearance of the stack or by observing the
gases passing through the boiler settings. A perfectly clear stack
indicates excess air, whereas smoke indicates a deficiency. With
properly designed furnaces the best results are secured by running near
the smoking point with a slight haze in the gases. A slight variation in
the air supply will affect the furnace conditions in an oil burning
boiler more than the same variation where coal is used, and for this
reason it is of the utmost importance that flue gas analysis be made
frequently on oil-burning boilers. With the air for combustion properly
regulated by adjustment of any checkerwork or any other device which may
be used, and the dampers carefully set, the flue gas analysis should
show, for good furnace conditions, a percentage of CO<sub>2</sub> between 13 and
14 per cent, with either no CO or but a trace.</p>

<p>In boiler plant operation it is difficult to regulate the steam supply
to the burners and the damper position to meet sudden and repeated
variations in the load. A device <span class="sidemark"><a name="page_224" id="page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span> has been patented which automatically
regulates by means of the boiler pressure the pressure of the steam to
the burners, the oil to the burners and the position of the boiler
damper. Such a device has been shown to give good results in plant
operation where hand regulation is difficult at best, and in many
instances is unfortunately not even attempted.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Efficiency with Oil</span>&mdash;As pointed out in enumerating the advantages of oil
fuel over coal, higher efficiencies are obtainable with the former. With
boilers of approximately 500 horse power equipped with properly designed
furnaces and burners, an efficiency of 83 per cent is possible or making
an allowance of 2 per cent for steam used by burners, a net efficiency
of 81 per cent. The conditions under which such efficiencies are to be
secured are distinctly test conditions in which careful operation is a
prime requisite. With furnace conditions that are not conductive to the
best combustion, this figure may be decreased by from 5 to 10 per cent.
In large properly designed plants, however, the first named efficiency
may be approached for uniform running conditions, the nearness to which
it is reached depending on the intelligence of the operating crew. It
must be remembered that the use of oil fuel presents to the careless
operator possibilities for wastefulness much greater than in plants
where coal is fired, and it therefore pays to go carefully into this
feature.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Burning Oil in Connection with Other Fuels</span>&mdash;Considerable attention has
been recently given to the burning of oil in connection with other
fuels, and a combination of this sort may be advisable either with the
view to increasing the boiler <span class="sidemark"><a name="page_225" id="page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span> capacity to assist over peak loads, or to
keep the boiler in operation where there is the possibility of a
temporary failure of the primary fuel. It would appear from experiments
that such a combination gives satisfactory results from the standpoint
of both capacity and efficiency, if the two fuels are burned in separate
furnaces. Satisfactory results cannot ordinarily be obtained when it is
attempted to burn oil fuel in the same furnace as the primary fuel, as
it is practically impossible to admit the proper amount of air for
combustion for each of the two fuels simultaneously. The Babcock &amp;
Wilcox boiler lends itself readily to a double furnace arrangement and
Fig. 30 shows an installation where oil fuel is burned as an auxiliary
to wood.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Water-gas Tar</span>&mdash;Water-gas tar, or gas-house tar, is a by-product of the
coal used in the manufacture of water gas. It is slightly heavier than
crude oil and has a comparatively low flash point. In burning, it should
be heated only to a temperature which makes it sufficiently fluid, and
any furnace suitable for crude oil is in general suitable for water-gas
tar. Care should be taken where this fuel is used to install a suitable
apparatus for straining it before it is fed to the burner. <span class="sidemark"><br /><a name="page_226" id="page_226">[Pg 226]</a>&nbsp;<a name="illo_226" id="illo_226"></a><a href="../plates/plate226.html" target="steampic" class="ilanchor">[Pl 226]</a></span></p>
