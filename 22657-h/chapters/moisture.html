<h2>MOISTURE IN STEAM</h2>


<p>The presence of moisture in steam causes a loss, not only in the
practical waste of the heat utilized to raise this moisture from the
temperature of the feed water to the temperature of the steam, but also
through the increased initial condensation in an engine cylinder and
through friction and other actions in a steam turbine. The presence of
such moisture also interferes with proper cylinder lubrication, causes a
knocking in the engine and a water hammer in the steam pipes. In steam
turbines it will cause erosion of the blades.</p>

<p>The percentage by weight of steam in a mixture of steam and water is
called the <i>quality of the steam</i>.</p>

<p>The apparatus used to determine the moisture content of steam is called
a calorimeter though since it may not measure the heat in the steam, the
name is not descriptive of the function of the apparatus. The first form
used was the &ldquo;barrel calorimeter&rdquo;, but the liability of error was so
great that its use was abandoned. Modern calorimeters are in general of
either the throttling or separator type.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Throttling Calorimeter</span>&mdash;Fig. 14 shows a typical form of throttling
calorimeter. Steam is drawn from a vertical main through the sampling
nipple, passes around the first thermometer cup, then through a
one-eighth inch orifice in a disk between two flanges, and lastly around
the second thermometer cup and to the atmosphere. Thermometers are
inserted in the wells, which should be filled with mercury or heavy
cylinder oil.</p>

<div class="blockleft"><img src="../images/png1291.png" alt="Throttling Calorimeter" title="Throttling Calorimeter" />
<h4><span class="smcap">Fig. 14. Throttling Calorimeter<br />and Sampling Nozzle</span></h4></div>

<p>The instrument and all pipes and fittings leading to it should be
thoroughly insulated to diminish radiation losses. Care must be taken to
prevent the orifice from becoming choked with dirt and to see that no
leaks occur. The exhaust pipe should be short to prevent back pressure
below the disk.</p>

<p>When steam passes through an orifice from a higher to a lower pressure,
as is the case with the throttling calorimeter, no external work has to
be done in overcoming a resistance. Hence, if there is no loss from
radiation, the quantity of heat in the steam will be exactly the same
after passing the orifice as before passing. If the higher steam
pressure is 160 pounds gauge and the lower pressure that of the
atmosphere, the total heat in a pound of dry steam at the former
pressure is 1195.9 B. t. u. and at the latter pressure 1150.4 B. t. u.,
a difference of 45.4 B. t. u. As this heat will still exist in the steam
at the lower pressure, since there is no external work done, its effect
must be to superheat the steam. Assuming the specific heat of
superheated steam to be 0.47, each pound passing through will be
superheated <sup>45.4</sup>&frasl;<sub>0.47</sub> = 96.6 degrees. If, however, the steam had
contained one per cent of moisture, it would have contained less heat
units per pound than if it were dry. Since the latent heat of steam at
160 <span class="sidemark"><a name="page_130" id="page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span> pounds gauge pressure is 852.8 B. t. u., it follows that the one per
cent of moisture would have required 8.5 B. t. u. to evaporate it,
leaving only 45.4 - 8.5 = 36.9 B. t. u. available for superheating;
hence, the superheat would be <sup>36.9</sup>&frasl;<sub>0.47</sub> = 78.5 degrees, as against 96.6
degrees for dry steam. In a similar manner, the degree of superheat for
other percentages of moisture may be determined. The action of the
throttling calorimeter is based upon the foregoing facts, as shown
below.</p>

<p>For practical work it is more convenient to dispense with the upper
thermometer in the calorimeter and to measure the pressure in the steam
main by an accurate steam pressure gauge.</p>

<p>A chart may be used for determining the value of <i>x</i> for approximate work
without the necessity for computation. Such a chart is shown in Fig. 15
and its use is as follows: Assume a gauge pressure of 180 pounds and a
thermometer reading of 295 degrees. The intersection of the vertical
line from the scale of temperatures as shown by the calorimeter
thermometer and the horizontal line from the scale of gauge pressures
will indicate directly the per cent of moisture in the steam as read
from the diagonal scale. In the present instance, this per cent is 1.0.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sources of Error in the Apparatus</span>&mdash;A slight error may arise from the
value, 0.47, used as the specific heat of superheated steam at
atmospheric pressure. This value, however is very nearly correct and any
error resulting from its use will be negligible.</p>

<p>There is ordinarily a larger source of error due to the fact that the
stem of the thermometer is not heated to its full length, to an initial
error in the thermometer and to radiation losses.</p>

<p>With an ordinary thermometer immersed in the well to the 100 degrees
mark, the error when registering 300 degrees would be about 3 degrees
and the true temperature be 303 degrees.<a name="fnanchor_19" id="fnanchor_19"></a><a href="#footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p>The steam is evidently losing heat through radiation from the moment it
enters the sampling nipple. The heat available for evaporating moisture
and superheating <span class="sidemark"><a name="page_131" id="page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span> steam after it has passed through the orifice into the
lower pressure will be diminished by just the amount lost through
radiation and the value of <i>t</i><sub>2</sub>, as shown by the calorimeter
thermometer, will, therefore, be lower than if there were no such loss.
The method of correcting for the thermometer and radiation error
recommended by the Power Test Committee of the American Society of
Mechanical Engineers is by referring the readings as found on the boiler
trial to a &ldquo;normal&rdquo; reading of the thermometer. This normal reading is
the reading of the lower calorimeter thermometer for dry saturated
steam, and should be determined by attaching the instrument to a
horizontal steam pipe in such a way that the sampling nozzle projects
upward to near the top of the pipe, there being no perforations in the
nozzle and the steam taken only through its open upper end. The test
should be made with the steam in a quiescent state and with the steam
pressure maintained as nearly as possible at the pressure observed in
the main trial, the calorimeter thermometer to be the same as was used
on the trial or one exactly similar.</p>

<p>With a normal reading thus obtained for a pressure approximately the
same as existed in the trial, the true percentage of moisture in the
steam, that is, with the proper correction made for radiation, may be
calculated as follows:</p>

<p>Let T denote the normal reading for the conditions existing in the
trial. The effect of radiation from the instrument as pointed out will
be to lower the temperature of the steam at the lower pressure. Let
<i>x</i><sub>1</sub> represent the proportion of water in the steam which will lower
its temperature an amount equal to the loss by radiation. Then,</p>

<div class="linecentr"><table cellspacing="0" class="blockcent">

<p>This amount of moisture, <i>x</i><sub>1</sub> was not in the steam originally but is
the result of condensation in the instrument through radiation. Hence,
the true amount of moisture in the steam represented by X is the
difference between the amount as determined in the trial and that
resulting from condensation, or,</p>

<p>As T and <i>t</i><sub>2</sub> are taken with the same thermometer under the same set of
conditions, any error in the reading of the thermometers will be
approximately the same for the temperatures T and <i>t</i><sub>2</sub> and the above
method therefore corrects for both the radiation and thermometer errors.
The theoretical readings for dry steam, where there are no losses due to
radiation, are obtainable from formula (<i><a href="#equn_5">5</a></i>) by letting <i>x</i> = 0 and solving
for <i>t</i><sub>2</sub>. The difference between the theoretical reading and the normal
reading for no moisture will be the thermometer and radiation correction
to be applied in order that the correct reading of <i>t</i><sub>2</sub> may be
obtained.</p>

<p>For any calorimeter within the range of its ordinary use, such a
thermometer and radiation correction taken from one normal reading is
approximately correct for any conditions with the same or a duplicate
thermometer.</p>

pressure in the trial to be 180 pounds and the thermometer reading to be

value of T = 303 degrees; then, the percentage of moisture corrected for
thermometer error and radiation is,</p>

<p>The chart may be used in the determination of the correct reading of
moisture percentage and the permanent radiation correction for the
instrument used without computation as follows: Assume the same trial
pressure, feed temperature and normal reading as above. If the normal
reading is found to be 303 degrees, the correction for thermometer and
radiation will be the theoretical reading for dry steam as found from
the chart, less this normal reading, or 10 degrees correction. The
correct temperature for the trial in question is, therefore, 305
degrees. The moisture corresponding to this temperature and 180 pounds
gauge pressure will be found from the chart to be 0.45 per cent.</p>

<div class="blockleft"><img src="../images/png1321.png" alt="Compact Throttling Calorimeter" title="Compact Throttling Calorimeter" />
<h4><span class="smcap">Fig. 16. Compact Throttling<br />Calorimeter</span></h4></div>

<p>There are many forms of throttling calorimeter, all of which work upon
the same principle. The simplest one is probably that shown in Fig. 14.
An extremely convenient and compact design is shown in Fig. 16. This
calorimeter consists of two concentric metal cylinders screwed to a cap
containing a thermometer well. The steam pressure is measured by a gauge
placed in the supply pipe or other convenient location. Steam passes
through the orifice <i>A</i> and expands to atmospheric pressure, its
temperature at this pressure being measured by a thermometer placed in
the cup <i>C</i>. To prevent as far as possible radiation losses, the annular
space between the two cylinders is used as a jacket, steam being
supplied to this space through the hole <i>B</i>.</p>

<p>The limits of moisture within which the throttling calorimeter will work
are, at sea level, from 2.88 per cent at 50 pounds gauge pressure and
7.17 per cent moisture at 250 pounds pressure.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Separating Calorimeter</span>&mdash;The separating calorimeter mechanically
separates the entrained water from the steam and collects it in a
reservoir, where its amount is <span class="sidemark"><a name="page_133" id="page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span> either indicated by a gauge glass or is
drained off and weighed. Fig. 17 shows a calorimeter of this type. The
steam passes out of the calorimeter through an orifice of known size so
that its total amount can be calculated or it can be weighed. A gauge is
ordinarily provided with this type of calorimeter, which shows the
pressure in its inner chamber and the flow of steam for a given period,
this latter scale being graduated by trial.</p>

<div class="blockrite"><img src="../images/png1331.png" alt="Separating Calorimeter" title="Separating Calorimeter" />
<h4><span class="smcap">Fig. 17. Separating Calorimeter</span></h4></div>

<p>The instrument, like a throttling calorimeter, should be well insulated
to prevent losses from radiation.</p>

<p>While theoretically the separating calorimeter is not limited in
capacity, it is well in cases where the percentage of moisture present
in the steam is known to be high, to attach a throttling calorimeter to
its exhaust. This, in effect, is the using of the separating calorimeter
as a small separator between the sampling nozzle and the throttling
instrument, and is necessary to insure the determination of the full
percentage of moisture in the steam. The sum of the percentages shown by
the two instruments is the moisture content of the steam.</p>

<p>The steam passing through a separating calorimeter may be calculated by
Napier&rsquo;s formula, the size of the orifice being known. There are
objections to such a calculation, however, in that it is difficult to
accurately determine the areas of such small orifices. Further, small
orifices have a tendency to become partly closed by sediment that may be
carried by the steam. The more accurate method of determining the amount
of steam passing through the instrument is as follows:</p>

<p>A hose should be attached to the separator outlet leading to a vessel of
water on a platform scale graduated to <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>100</sub> of a pound. The steam
outlet should be connected to another vessel of water resting on a
second scale. In each case, the weight of each vessel and its contents
should be noted. When ready for an observation, the instrument should be
blown out thoroughly so that there will be no water within the
separator. The separator drip should then be closed and the steam hose
inserted into the vessel of water at the same instant. When the
separator has accumulated a sufficient quantity of water, the valve of
the instrument should be closed and the hose removed from the vessel of
water. The separator should be emptied into the vessel on its scale. The
final weight of each vessel and its contents are to be noted and the
differences between the final and original weights will represent the
weight of moisture collected by the separator and the weight of steam
from which the moisture has been taken. The proportion of moisture can
then be calculated from the following formula:</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sampling Nipple</span>&mdash;The principle source of error in steam calorimeter
determinations is the failure to obtain an average sample of the steam
delivered by the boiler and it is extremely doubtful whether such a
sample is ever obtained. The two governing features in the obtaining of
such a sample are the type of sampling nozzle used and its location.</p>

<p>The American Society of Mechanical Engineers recommends a sampling
nozzle made of one-half inch iron pipe closed at the inner end and the
interior portion perforated with not less than twenty one-eighth inch
holes equally distributed from end to end and preferably drilled in
irregular or spiral rows, with the first hole not less than one-half
inch from the wall of the pipe. Many engineers object to the use of a
perforated sampling nipple because it ordinarily indicates a higher
percentage of moisture than is actually present in the steam. This is
due to the fact that if the perforations come close to the inner surface
of the pipe, the moisture, which in many instances clings to this
surface, will flow into the calorimeter and cause a large error. Where a
perforated nipple is used, in general it may be said that the
perforations should be at least one inch from the inner pipe surface.</p>

<p>A sampling nipple, open at the inner end and unperforated, undoubtedly
gives as accurate a measure as can be obtained of the moisture in the
steam passing that end. It would appear that a satisfactory method of
obtaining an average sample of the steam would result from the use of an
open end unperforated nipple passing through a stuffing box which would
allow the end to be placed at any point across the diameter of the steam
pipe.</p>

<div class="blockleft"><img src="../images/png1341.png" alt="Sampling Nozzle" title="Sampling Nozzle" />
<h4><span class="smcap">Fig. 18. Stott and Pigott<br />Sampling Nozzle</span></h4></div>

<p>Incidental to a test of a 15,000 K. W. steam engine turbine unit, Mr.
H. G. Stott and Mr. R. G. S. Pigott, finding no experimental data
bearing on the subject of low pressure steam quality determinations,
made a investigation of the subject and the sampling nozzle illustrated
in Fig. 18 was developed. In speaking of sampling nozzles in the
determination of the moisture content of low pressure steam, Mr. Pigott
says, &ldquo;the ordinary standard perforated pipe sampler is absolutely
worthless in giving a true sample and it is vital that the sample be
abstracted from the main without changing its direction or velocity
until it is safely within the sample pipe and entirely isolated from the
rest of the steam.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It would appear that the nozzle illustrated is undoubtedly the best that
has been developed for use in the determination of the moisture content
of steam, not only in the case of low, but also in high pressure steam.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Location of Sampling Nozzle</span>&mdash;The calorimeter should be located as near
as possible to the point from which the steam is taken and the sampling
nipple should be placed in a section of the main pipe near the boiler
and where there is no chance of moisture pocketing in the pipe. The
American Society of Mechanical Engineers recommends that a sampling
nipple, of which a description has been given, should be located in a
vertical main, rising from the boiler with its closed end extending
nearly <span class="sidemark"><a name="page_135" id="page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span> across the pipe. Where non-return valves are used, or where there
are horizontal connections leading from the boiler to a vertical outlet,
water may collect at the lower end of the uptake pipe and be blown
upward in a spray which will not be carried away by the steam owing to a
lack of velocity. A sample taken from the lower part of this pipe will
show a greater amount of moisture than a true sample. With goose-neck
connections a small amount of water may collect on the bottom of the
pipe near the upper end where the inclination is such that the tendency
to flow backward is ordinarily counterbalanced by the flow of steam
forward over its surface; but when the velocity momentarily decreases
the water flows back to the lower end of the goose-neck and increases
the moisture at that point, making it an undesirable location for
sampling. In any case, it should be borne in mind that with low
velocities the tendency is for drops of entrained water to settle to the
bottom of the pipe, and to be temporarily broken up into spray whenever
an abrupt bend or other disturbance is met.</p>

<blockquote>
<h5>Case 1&mdash;Horizontal pipe. Water flows at bottom. If perforations
in nozzle are too near bottom of pipe, water piles against
nozzle, flows into calorimeter and gives false reading.
Case 2&mdash;If nozzle located too near junction of two horizontal
runs, as at <i>a</i>, condensation from vertical pipe which collects
at this point will be thrown against the nozzle by the velocity
of the steam, resulting in a false reading. Nozzle should be
located far enough above junction to be removed from water kept
in motion by the steam velocity, as at <i>b</i>. Case 3&mdash;Condensation
in bend will be held by velocity of the steam as shown. When
velocity is diminished during firing intervals and the like
moisture flows back against nozzle, <i>a</i>, and false reading is
obtained. A true reading will be obtained at <i>b</i> provided
condensation is not blown over on nozzle. Case 4&mdash;Where
non-return valve is placed before a bend, condensation will
collect on steam line side and water will be swept by steam
velocity against nozzle and false readings result.</h5>

<p>Fig. 19 indicates certain locations of sampling nozzles from which
erroneous results will be obtained, the reasons being obvious from a
study of the cuts.</p>

<p>Before taking any calorimeter reading, steam should be allowed to flow
through the instrument freely until it is thoroughly heated. The method
of using a throttling calorimeter is evident from the description of the
instrument given and the principle upon which it works. <span class="sidemark"><br /><a name="page_136" id="page_136">[Pg 136]</a>&nbsp;<a name="illo_136" id="illo_136"></a><a href="../plates/plate136.html" target="steampic" class="ilanchor">[Pl 136]</a></span></p>
